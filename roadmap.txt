Phase 1: Data Source and Storage Setup

Source Data Planning

Find suitable sample Excel data (consider sales, customer, or inventory data)
Structure should be complex enough to demonstrate data warehousing skills
Multiple related tables would be ideal to show dimensional modeling


AWS S3 Configuration

Create an S3 bucket with appropriate permissions
Plan folder structure (raw/landing zone, processed, archived)
Consider versioning and lifecycle policies



Phase 2: ETL Pipeline Development

Lambda Function Design

Trigger: S3 event when new file is uploaded
File processing: Excel parsing and transformation
Consider error handling and logging
Data validation and cleansing steps


Redshift Setup

Cluster configuration planning
Schema design (fact and dimension tables)
Security groups and IAM roles
Consider implementing a star or snowflake schema



Phase 3: Data Loading Strategy

ETL Process Flow

Extract: Read from S3
Transform: Data type conversion, cleaning, formatting
Load: Efficient loading into Redshift
Consider implementing COPY commands for bulk loading



Phase 4: Frontend Addition (This will make you stand out)

Architecture Planning

Web application framework (React/Vue/Angular)
API Gateway to interact with AWS services
Authentication and authorization


Frontend Features

Dashboard for data visualization
Upload interface for Excel files
Status tracking for ETL processes
Basic data exploration capabilities



Phase 5: Monitoring and Maintenance

Monitoring Setup

CloudWatch metrics and alarms
Pipeline status monitoring
Cost tracking
Error notification system



Additional Considerations to Stand Out:

Data Quality

Implement data quality checks
Data profiling reports
Error handling and notification system


Documentation

Architecture diagrams
Setup instructions
API documentation
Data dictionary


Advanced Features

Incremental loading capability
Data lineage tracking
Basic data governance implementation
Performance optimization techniques
